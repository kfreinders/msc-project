# Inferring *nosoi* Simulation Parameters from Summary Statistics

This project explores the ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to recover the
original parameters of *nosoi* agent-based simulations from a set of summary
statistics. The focus is on how data scarcity impacts the quality of parameter
inference, with future work extending toward graph-based learning using Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs).

## Usage

---

### 1. Set *nosoi* Simulation Settings (R)

Edit [`R/config.R`](R/config.R) to set:

* The simulation parameters:
    * The number of simulations
    * The maximum simulation length in days
    * The maximum allowed number of infected individuals
    * The number of initially infected individuals
    * The target output directory

* Lower and upper bounds for each parameter of interest:
    * Mean incubation time
    * Standard deviation in incubation time
    * Mean number of contacts per individual per time step
    * Probability of transmission
    * Probability of death
    * Recovery time

Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) will be used to sample the specified parameter
space, to ensure as many different parameter combinations as possible are
simulated.
